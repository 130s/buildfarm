server.yaml
===========

To use this it will look for server.yaml in $ROS_HOME/catkin-debs for credentials like rosci.  Put your jenkins login in this file.  

url: http://jenkins.willowgarage.com:8080
username: USERNAME
password: PASSWORD

Reconfiguring Jenkins
=====================

To reconfigure jenkins run the create_release_jobs.py script.  

Use the repo-workspace argument to cache the gbp repos locally, so you only have to update not clone the whole repo every time. .  

fuerte
------

    scripts/create_release_jobs.py --repo /tmp/fuerterepo fuerte --commit

Groovy
------
For groovy use the groovy-devel branch.  And right now we're only building precise. 

    scripts/create_release_jobs.py --repo /tmp/groovyrepo groovy --commit --distros precise

If a package has been renamed or removed use the --delete option to remove jobs other than the ones just configured. 

Triggering new builds
=====================

Once you have made a new release into a gbp repo, and updated the 
version number in the rosdistro.yaml file.  Run trigger_missing.py

For groovy use the groovy-devel branch. 

    scripts/trigger_missing.py groovy --commit
